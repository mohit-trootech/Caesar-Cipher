The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encrypting messages, named after Julius Caesar, who
reportedly used it to protect his military communications. This technique involves shifting the letters of the alphabet
by a fixed number of places. For example, with a shift of three, the letter â€˜Aâ€™ becomes â€˜Dâ€™, â€˜Bâ€™ becomes â€˜Eâ€™, and so on.
Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher formed the groundwork for modern cryptographic techniques.

- Run main.py File, Prompt Ask user for Plain Text, and Key.
- Key Must be in Integer Format else ValueError.
- Encryption and Decryption Separate Modules are Used for Respective Process.
- Encryption and Decryption Process Uses ASCII Digits.
- Brute Force Check Added with Password Data
